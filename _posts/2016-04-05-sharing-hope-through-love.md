## Sharing Hope Through Love

For many years I have had this ministry on my heart.  I have put it off, thinking I need to me personal finances and career sorted out before I started.  Lately, I feel the Lord saying that is like saying I don't trust him to take care of me, to provide for this purpose he has laid on my life.  So here I am launching a website for a ministry that is barely formed.

The mission the Lord has laid on my heart is to help orphans and the fatherless achieve their God-given potential and use it for His glory.

I have so many ideas about what this will look like.  Ways I can use all the things I have learned to help young people who find themselves without the support of family to fall back on.  Our foster care system fails children in many ways.  One of which is that as soon as a child turns eighteen, they age out of the system and are on their own.

No one has taught them how to survive, let alone succeed, in the world.  They don't know how to interview for a job, how to rent an apartment, how to look into colleges.  Many basically lack the skills to be an adult. Who has those skills at eighteen?

Vision Unbound will be a place for these young people to come and learn how to be an adult.  They will start with an in house leadership training program.  There will be mentors and counselors.  We will be a working horse farm and everyone will be expected to pitch in and learn jobs on the farm.  Whether that be working with the horses, marketing, fundraising, or keeping the dorms in order, everyone will take part.  After they have completed the initial phase, we will help them get apprenticeships or attend college so that they can pursue their dreams.  The only pre-requisite is that they desire to succeed and be willing to do what it takes to achieve their dreams, even if they don't yet know what those dreams are.

We want to create a safe space for them to figure out what God created them to do and be and help them get the opportunity to pursue the desires of their hearts.
